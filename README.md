# PHP Restful API Starter Kit - Database Scripts

A starter kit for the restful API database scripts. These database scripts support the PHP Restful API Starter Kit project found at: https://github.com/vuchkov/medium-php-api-starter

This code accompanies my Medium article entitled, "How to Build a Simple Restful API in PHP" 
located at: https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-build-a-simple-restful-api-in-php-c719f03cfa0a

## Example Code

All of the example code is available in the following three GitHub repositories. Feel free to download and use this code any way you want, without attribution:

- Back-end API: https://github.com/vuchkov/medium-php-api-starter
- Client-side front end: https://github.com/vuchkov/medium-php-api-starter-client
- Database scripts: https://github.com/vuchkov/medium-php-api-starter-dbscripts

This project is built on my a localhost with the back-end API in one project and the client-side front end in a separate project. To make this simple demonstration work, there are some hardcoded references (e.g., database connection details, API host URL, etc). For now, the idea is to just keep it simple.

The development environment is set up entirely in Docker containers using the instructions you can find in the article, â€œHow to Run Your Entire Development Environment in Docker Containers on macOS: https://betterprogramming.pub/php-how-to-run-your-entire-development-environment-in-docker-containers-on-macos-787784e94f9a.
